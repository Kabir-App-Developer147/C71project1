        The lab is dedicated to sustaining the idea of multiple possibilities and alternative values in the face of an increasingly monolithic worldview of our technological future. 
        It uses design as a catalyst for a form of interdisciplinary imagining that synthesizes social and political thought, world-making, and emerging technology.

        <br>
        <br>
        At its core is the idea that imagination can be a political force within society.</p>
